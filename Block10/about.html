        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active and being creative. Here
          are a few of my interests:
        </p>

        <h3>Car Performance Tuning</h3>
        <p>
          I love working on performance upgrades for cars, especially BMWs- fine
          tuning engines and enhancing driving experiences by changing the
          exhaust system, suspension, and more.

        <h3>Video Games and Computers</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy playing video games, in particular Call of Duty. I also enjoy
          building my own computers, optimizing them for gaming and
          productivity, as well as trying to have a clean and efficient set
          up.(cable management is a must with my OCD!)
        </p>

        <h3>Sports and in Particular Rugby</h3>
        <p>
          I have played rugby for many years and enjoy the teamwork and strategy
          involved in the game. It's a great way to stay fit and challenge
          myself.
